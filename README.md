###  ðŸ‘‹ 'ello there! I'm Michael!

## Musician => Construction Worker => Software Developer

## My Journey

The journey I took to become a Software Developer had a few twists and turns but I know I found it at the right time in my life. Everything else I learned along the way contributes in some way to my skills as a Software Developer, whether it's how music showed me how to think differently and work as one important piece of a whole, or how construction taught me about perseverance and integrity.

As a Software Developer, I love that I'm able to take an idea from nothing to physically (digitally) interacting with it and reaping the benefits of my hard work. If you haven't, I encourage you to take a look at my favorite personal project, [buttery](https://github.com/michael-gann/buttery), where I've built an app based off of one of my passions, baking.

I've learned there's rarely ever one way to do something and that the hardest part when making a decision is figuring out if the pros outweigh the cons, which gets more difficult the more pieces you try to fit together. Luckily, I love figuring out how things work, whether in video games or the tech world, and exploiting that knowledge to be as efficient as possible making a decision.

I have two dogs, one cat, and one bonsai tree under my care. Let me know if you want to chat, I'd love to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-gann-1a2161201/)!
